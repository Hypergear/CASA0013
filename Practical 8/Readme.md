## Practical 8 - Visualising Data

Hello! Welcome to week 8 of [Foundation for Spatial Data Science](https://github.com/jreades/fsds/blob/master/Syllabus.md#preparation-8) CASA0013 Lecture with materials by Jon Reades.

This week practical is about Visualisation! You will learn how to manipulate your data using numpy and pandas python libraries to create beautiful graphs using seaborn and matplotlib. We will discuss in depth how to group, link, aggregate spatial data. Hope you will enjoy it! 

### Here are some useful links for this week:
- [10 Free GIS Data Sources: Best Global Raster and Vector Datasets](https://gisgeography.com/best-free-gis-data-sources-raster-vector/) Article by GISGeography about great open data portal to access spatial data. 
- [Complete Guid to Data Visualisation with Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/complete-guide-to-data-visualization-with-python-2dd74df12b5e) A very good article by Albert Sanchez Lafuente reviewing mapplotlib, seaborn, bokeh, folium and how to use them to create powerful visualisation. 


Official Documentation
- [sjoin parameters](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/reference/api/geopandas.sjoin.html) Official geopandas documentation reviewing the parameters for sjoin. 
- [An Introduction to Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/relational.html) Official documentation to use seaborn. Great introduction. To learn more about how to visualise statistical relationships, have a look at one of their other tutorial.
