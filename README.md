Welcome to the lecture CASA0013 "Foundation for Spatial Data Science", year 2021/2022. My name is Aude and I am a teaching assistant for the module. I look forward to supporting you in your learning and exploring how to start with programming. 

##### The goals for this module are the following: 
  - Practice coding, learn the languages of computer (Python)
  - Understand what is Spatial Data Science - What are the stages of analysis? How to extract insights? 
  - Read and discuss about "Data & Ethics" - Where do data come from? How can they be used, abused?

##### Tips & Tricks 
- Every week I will upload on this github tips & tricks to succeed in the practical sessions. Feel free to have a look at it :-)
