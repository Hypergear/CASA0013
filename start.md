##Hello World!

I am a new Markdown File or if you prefer .md file. I have been created via the terminal using _touch_ and I am being edited with _nano_. 

Here are some useful tips that you should remember:
1. write in plain text
2. create header using #, ##, ###
3. write in _Italic_ or in **Bold**
4. create list with - and 1.
5. insert links with [link test](url) ! Check [www.casa.ucl.ac.uk](url) if you wonder what we do here!
6. insert images with ![Alt text](url)
7. insert some code with `...` try 'print("Hello World")`

Feel free to add anything I may have missed. :-)
