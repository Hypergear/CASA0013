Hello!

Welcome to week 7 of the Foundation for spatial data science lecture. Today we are going to explore textual data. [Here](https://github.com/jreades/fsds/tree/master/lectures) you can find the materials for the lectures as well as the practical for week 7. 

As always, here are is a serie of links that are useful:
