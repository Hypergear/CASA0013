### Practical 2

Hello! This week we are going to dive into the basics of python. 
1. Variables (type, assignment, operators)
2. Conditions (comparison, logic operators)
3. Lists (index, order, add, remove)

The link for the FSDS Practical 2 is [here, jreades GitHub](https://github.com/jreades/fsds/blob/master/practicals/Practical-02-Foundations_1.ipynb).

##### A few nice readings for this week:
- ["How to learn programming - The guide I wish I had when I started learning to code"](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-learn-programming/)
A nice article by Jacob Stopak about how computers work, how we use programming language to communicate with them and a few tips to start with python! Enjoy.
- ["Python Built-In Functions"](https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/functions.html#func-list) 
A useful page with the built-in functions from the python interpreter. Good to know which one exist and which one do what, it will avoid you some long headaches :-) 
- ["Data Scientists: Your variable names are awfule. Here's how to fis them"](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-scientists-your-variable-names-are-awful-heres-how-to-fix-them-89053d2855be)
I am sure your variables names will be great! Be sure to read this great blogpost by Will Kohersen to chose readable, understandable variables names in your code! 

Feel free to share any other articles that you have came across and may be useful for others students!
