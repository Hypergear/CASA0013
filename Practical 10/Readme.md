### Practical 10 - Grouping Data

Welcome to week 10 of [Foundation for Spatial Data Science](https://github.com/jreades/fsds/blob/master/Syllabus.md#preparation-10) CASA0013 Lecture with materials by Jon Reades. 

This week is the last week of the module and we are exploring techniques of "clustering data". After completion of this practical, you will:
- Know how to prepare data to apply cllustering techniques
- Understand the difference between spatial and non-spatial clustering techniques
- Be familiar with clustering algorithms such as K-Means, DBSCAN (Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise) and optics (Ordering points to identify the clustering structure).

*Here are some good articles on the topic*:
