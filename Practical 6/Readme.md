### Hello World! 

Welcome to week 6 of Foundation for Spatial Data Science. 

Useful links for this week:
- What is the difference between shapefile and GeoJson? The article by Nikhil Hubbali [Why you need to use Geopacakage files instead of shapefile or GeoJSON?](https://samashti.tech/why-you-need-to-use-geopackage-files-instead-of-shapefile-or-geojson/) and the one by Juho HÃ¤me [Shapefile vs. GeoJSON vs. GeoPackage](https://samashti.tech/why-you-need-to-use-geopackage-files-instead-of-shapefile-or-geojson/) are two very good reads to understand the stories, problems and benefits of these different files format. 
- [Matplotlib Legend Arguments](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.legend.html) Matplotlib documentation. This page is very useful to understand the different parameters link to the legend arguments of your graph. 
- [Matplotlib Specifying Colors](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/colors/colors.html) Matplotlib documentation on how to specify colors for your graphs. If you want to use other colors palette, you can also use color hex code. [View HTML color code here!](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/)
