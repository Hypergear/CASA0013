### Practical 3

Hello! This week we are going to learn more about creating and using lists and dictionaries. 

The link for the FSDS Practical 3 is [here, jreades GitHub](https://github.com/jreades/fsds/blob/master/practicals/Practical-03-Foundations_2.ipynb)

*A few nice readings for this week:*
- ["Dictionaries in Python"](https://realpython.com/python-dicts/) by John Sturtz. A great summary of all the essentials for working with dictionaries in Python.
